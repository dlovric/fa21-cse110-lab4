### Part2:
Question 1: The value of i will be printed out at line 12 without error, this indicates how many times the program went through the for loop

Question 2: The value of the discounted price will be printed out at line 13 without error, the value printed will be 150

Question 3: The value of the final price will be printed out at line 14 without error, the value printed will be 150

Question 4: when discounted is returned, it outputs the values that were put into the function at a discount, in this case it will output [ 50, 100, 150 ]

Question 5: The code causes an error, this is because the  console log is outside of the for loop and does not have access to the variable i

Question 6: line 13 will cause an error because discounted price is declared within the for code block and the statement does not have access to the variable

Question 7: similar to question 6, final price is also declared inside of the code block and has access to it, and the output value produced by line 14 is 150

Question 8: A value will be returned by the function and that value is [ 50, 100, 150 ]

Question 9: Line 11 will cause an error because it is not within the for code block where i is created 

Question 10: Line 12 will produce the value of length which does not change and produces the value 3

Question 11: The output once again will be the discount of the original price, the code does not contain an error and the value outputted is [ 50, 100, 150 ] 
### Data Types
Question 12:

A. student.name;

B. student['Grad year'];

C. student.greeting();

D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name;

E. student.courseload[0];

### Basic Operators and Type Conversion
Question 13:

A. '32', number 2 is appended onto 3 as a string

B. 1, used mathematical subtraction to get 1

C. 3, null was added to 3, resulting in 3

D. '3null', the string null was appeneded to 3

E. 4, true is equal to 1 mathematically and was added to 3

F. 0, false is equal to 0 and was added to null, resulting in 0

G. '3undefined', the string undefined was appened to 3

H. NaN, also known as undefined, could not subtract 3 from something that was undefined

Question 14:

A. true, the statement evaluated the values of 2 and one and 2 is greater than 1, returning true

B. false, the statement evaluated the first character of both strings and determined that 1 was less than 2, so false

C. true, the character 2 and the value 2 are equal (this is a regular equality check)

D. false, the character 2 and the value 2 are two separate types, thus returning false (strict equality check)

E. false, true evaluates to 1, and 1 != 2, thus false

F. true, Boolean(2) evaluates to true as long as its not 0, and true is strictly equal to true as they are both booleans (strict equality check passes)

Question 15: == is just a regular equality check and only checks value, while === is a strict equality check that checks both type and value
