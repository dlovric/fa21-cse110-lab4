### Part1:
Question 1: Line 9 prints: "values added: 20"

Question 2: Line 13 prints: "final result: 20"

Question 3: Line 9 prints: "values added: 20"

Question 4: Line 13 returns an error because let is inside of the if statement and the result cannot reference it

Question 5: The code returns an error, line 9 is not printed because since result is a constant, it cannot be changed and the problem lies when we try to change the value of result to num1+num2

Question 6: code returns an error, line 9 is not printed for the same reason as above
### Part2:
Question 1: The value of i will be printed out at line 12 without error, this indicates how many times the program went through the for loop

Question 2: The value of the discounted price will be printed out at line 13 without error, the value printed will be 150

Question 3: The value of the final price will be printed out at line 14 without error, the value printed will be 150

Question 4: when discounted is returned, it outputs the values that were put into the function at a discount, in this case it will output [ 50, 100, 150 ]

Question 5: The code causes an error, this is because the  console log is outside of the for loop and does not have access to the variable i

Question 6: line 13 will cause an error because discounted price is declared within the for code block and the statement does not have access to the variable

Question 7: similar to question 6, final price is also declared inside of the code block and has access to it, and the output value produced by line 14 is 150

Question 8: A value will be returned by the function and that value is [ 50, 100, 150 ]

Question 9: Line 11 will cause an error because it is not within the for code block where i is created 

Question 10: Line 12 will produce the value of length which does not change and produces the value 3
Question 11: The output once again will be the discount of the original price, the code does not contain an error and the value outputted is [ 50, 100, 150 ]
