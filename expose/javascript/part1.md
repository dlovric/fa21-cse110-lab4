### Part1:
Question 1: Line 9 prints: "values added: 20"

Question 2: Line 13 prints: "final result: 20"

Question 3: Line 9 prints: "values added: 20"

Question 4: Line 13 returns an error because let is inside of the if statement and the result cannot reference it

Question 5: The code returns an error, line 9 is not printed because since result is a constant, it cannot be changed and the problem lies when we try to change the value of result to num1+num2

Question 6: code returns an error, line 9 is not printed for the same reason as above
